### The TypeScript Handbook
- [Basic Types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html)
For programs to be useful, we need to be able to work with some of the simplest units of data: numbers, strings, structures, boolean values, and the like. In TypeScript, we support much the same types as you would expect in JavaScript, with a convenient enumeration type thrown in to help things along.

- [Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)
One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural subtyping”. In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.
